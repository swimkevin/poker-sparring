# AGENTS.md — poker-sparring

Repo conventions for AI coding agents. The full guide is `CLAUDE.md` — read it
first; this file is the 30-second version.

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, zero runtime dependencies, no build step. Deployed to
  GitHub Pages from `main`.
- Layering: `cards → evaluator → equity → engine → bots` are **DOM-free** and run
  in Node tests. `ui.js` renders only; `app.js` conducts. Keep it that way.
- Cross-file globals need a guarded `require` block for Node (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- Engine actions go through `table.legalActions(idx)`; bet/raise `amount` is the
  TOTAL street bet target.
- `npm test` (unit + component) must pass before pushing. Add a targeted test
  with every engine/bot/equity change.
- Never `innerHTML` user-controlled strings without `UI.escapeHtml`.
- Keep functions small, comment the decision points, no emojis in code comments.
